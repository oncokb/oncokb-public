Additionally, deletion of TP53 in the neurons of mice, while not sufficient to cause tumor development, allows the accumulation of other oncogenic mutations leading to tumorigenesis (PMID: 19477430). Further, loss of TP53 protein during 17p deletion events in leukemia/lymphoma, enhances cancer development through cooperation of linked tumor suppressive genes such as EIF5A and ALOX15B (PMID: 26982726).",

The ZBP-89/mutant TP53 interaction abrogated induction of the cell cycle gene p21 and other apoptotic proteins, leading to reduced apoptosis (PMID: 22214764). Additionally, expression of this mutation in head and neck cancer cell lines was associated with the inability of TP53 to suppress colony growth, as compared to wildtype TP53 and is associated with reduced expression of p21 suggesting that the G245D mutation inactivates the function of p53 (PMID: 25119136).",
