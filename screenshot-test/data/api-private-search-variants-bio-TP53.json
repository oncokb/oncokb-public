Expression of this mutant in TP53-null cells resulted in decreased transactivation of p53 target genes, as a measured by a luciferase reporter assay (PMID: 25584008). Additionally, the TP53 R248L mutation failed to suppress colony growth in a colony reduction assay compared to wildtype TP53 (PMID: 25584008). Ovarian cancer patient samples and mouse models expressing this mutation were sensitive to an amyloid aggregate TP53 inhibitor as evidenced by apoptosis assays. Some TP53 mutations have been shown to form amyloid aggregates that leads to inactivation of the TP53 protein. Responsiveness of this variant to amyloid aggregate inhibitors suggest that this is a loss-of-function mutation (PMID: 26748848).",

Additionally, immortalized G334R-mutant lymphoblastoid cell lines demonstrated impaired activation of a subset of TP53 target genes (including PCLO, PLTP, PLXNB3 and LCN15) following treatment with Nutlin-3A.

Additionally, deletion of TP53 in the neurons of mice, while not sufficient to cause tumor development, allows the accumulation of other oncogenic mutations leading to tumorigenesis (PMID: 19477430). Further, loss of TP53 protein during 17p deletion events in leukemia/lymphoma, enhances cancer development through cooperation of linked tumor suppressive genes such as EIF5A and ALOX15B (PMID: 26982726).",

Mutations in the DBD result in altered contact of p53 with its target DNA sequences, thereby altering its transcriptional function (PMID: 8023157, 11900253). Given that p53 directs the transcription of proteins that enable apoptosis (PMID: 11900253), its inactivation results in cells harboring damaged DNA and overall genomic instability (PMID: 11900253). Expression of the R273L mutation in cell lines that lack p53 expression did not enhance p53-mediated transcriptional activity in reporter assays, as compared to expression of wildtype TP53 (PMID: 15037740).",

Structural studies have shown that this mutation results in differences in conformational flexibility of the DNA-binding domain of p53 (PMID: 22803791). Expression of this mutant in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines resulted in association with the transcription factor ZBP-89 in the cytoplasm. The ZBP-89/mutant TP53 interaction abrogated induction of the cell cycle gene p21 and other apoptotic proteins, leading to reduced apoptosis (PMID: 22214764). Additionally, expression of this mutation in head and neck cancer cell lines was associated with the inability of TP53 to suppress colony growth, as compared to wildtype TP53 and is associated with reduced expression of p21 suggesting that the G245D mutation inactivates the function of p53 (PMID: 25119136).",
