        "background": "BRAF is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a key role in the regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (PMID: 15520807), which under physiologic conditions regulates the expression of genes involved in cellular functions, including proliferation (PMID: 24202393). Genetic alterations in BRAF are found in a large percentage of melanomas, thyroid cancers and histiocytic neoplasms as well as a small fraction of lung and colorectal cancers. The most common BRAF point mutation is V600E, which deregulates the protein's kinase activity leading to constitutive BRAF activation, as BRAF V600E can signal as a monomer independently of RAS or upstream activation (PMID: 20179705). Other BRAF mutations have been found that affect the protein's propensity to dimerize (PMID: 16858395, 26343582, 12068308). The product of these alterations is a BRAF kinase that can activate MAPK signaling in an unregulated manner and, in some instances, is directly responsible for cancer growth (PMID: 15520807). Inhibitors of mutant BRAF, including vemurafenib and dabrafenib, are FDA-approved for the treatment of late-stage or unresectable melanoma.",

        "background": "The ROS1 gene encodes a transmembrane protein with intracellular tyrosine kinase activity (PMID: 18778756). ROS1 is a member of the sevenless subfamily of tyrosine kinase insulin receptor genes (PMID: 27256160). The normal physiological role and ligand of this protein in humans is currently unknown (PMID: 23814043). ROS1 rearrangements where the kinase domain is retained (PMID: 22327623) are implicated in a range of human epithelial cancers including cholangiocarcinoma (PMID: 21253578), ovarian carcinoma (PMID: 22163003), gastric carcinoma (PMID: 23400546), angiosarcoma (PMID: 23637631) and most commonly non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 22215748). Although ROS1 rearrangements were first discovered in a human glioblastoma cell line (PMID: 2827175), there is a paucity of ROS1 rearrangements in human gliomas (PMID: 24999209). The mechanism by which ROS1 rearrangements leads to dysregulated kinase activity is not clear, as its ligand has not yet been deciphered; however, it is hypothesized to occur through constitutive kinase activation (PMID: 18083107).",
