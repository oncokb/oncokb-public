FDA approval of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib was based on results from an open-label Phase III study of combination therapy versus dabrafenib monotherapy in 247 patients with metastatic melanoma who were naive to treatment with BRAF inhibitors. Combined dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, improved the response rate in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma versus dabrafenib monotherapy (67% vs.51%; p<0.002). However, median progression-free survival improved by only 2 weeks (9.3 months vs 8.8 months; HR = 0.75) compared with dabrafenib monotherapy (PMID: 23020132). Combination therapy is associated with less cutaneous toxicity than monotherapy, but systemic toxicity may be increased (PMID: 25287827, 25399551). Follow-up trials have demonstrated that all clinical measures inclusive of overall and median progression-free survival as well as objective response rates, median duration of response and number of patients with complete response favored patients treated with combination dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, compared to either dabrafenib or vemurafenib monotherapy, including patients who previously progressed on BRAF inhibitor monotherapy (PMID: 25287827, 25399551, 25265492). Additionally, patients with melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings have improved survival over patients given standard of care (PMID: 29361468, 28991513, 28891408). Promising clinical data has also suggested that addition of an immunotherapy agent to combination RAF and MEK inhibitor treatment may improve rate of overall response and duration of response in melanoma patients (PMID: 31171876, 31171879, 31171878)."

Trametinib demonstrated improved progression-free survival (HR for disease progression or death = 0.45) and six-month overall survival (81% vs. 67%; death HR = 0.54; p=0.01) (PMID: 22663011). However, like other MEK inhibitors, the benefit of trametinib is limited by adverse reactions, most notably grade three or four rash and diarrhea (PMID: 22663011). Trametinib is not typically used as monotherapy for patients with BRAF V600K melanoma given its lower response rate compared to BRAF inhibitors and combined BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Patients previously treated with a RAF inhibitor appear to be less likely than untreated patients to respond to trametinib treatment (PMID: 22663011), and FDA guidelines state that trametinib as a monotherapy is not indicated for these patients. Dabrafenib and trametinib are FDA-approved as a combination therapy, which has superior clinical outcomes compared to dabrafenib or trametinib monotherapy (PMID: 25399551, 25265492).

In a randomized Phase III trial comparing vemurafenib (960 mg orally twice daily) with dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2 i.v. every 3 weeks) for treatment-naive, metastatic, BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma, vemurafenib was associated with better overall survival (median survival 13.6 months vs. 9.7 months; hazard ratio 0.70, p=.0008) and longer median progression-free survival (6.9 months vs. 1.6 months) (PMID: 24508103). Final overall survival data from the BRIM-3 study showed that the survival advantage of vemurafenib over dacarbazine persisted through the 4-year landmark, with survival rates for vemurafenib and dacarbazine at the 4-year landmark being 17.0% and 15.6%, respectively (PMID: 28961848).

Genetic alterations in BRAF are found in a large percentage of melanomas, thyroid cancers and histiocytic neoplasms as well as a small fraction of lung and colorectal cancers. The most common BRAF point mutation is V600E, which deregulates the protein's kinase activity leading to constitutive BRAF activation, as BRAF V600E can signal as a monomer independently of RAS or upstream activation (PMID: 20179705). Other BRAF mutations have been found that affect the protein's propensity to dimerize (PMID: 16858395, 26343582, 12068308). The product of these alterations is a BRAF kinase that can activate MAPK signaling in an unregulated manner and, in some instances, is directly responsible for cancer growth (PMID: 15520807). Inhibitors of mutant BRAF, including vemurafenib and dabrafenib, are FDA-approved for the treatment of late-stage or unresectable melanoma.",

          "description": "Dabrafenib, an orally bioavailable RAF inhibitor, and trametinib, an orally bioavailable MEK1/2 inhibitor, are FDA-approved alone or in combination for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma harboring a V600E or V600K BRAF mutation. FDA approval of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib was based on results from an open-label Phase III study of combination therapy versus dabrafenib monotherapy in 247 patients with metastatic melanoma who were naive to treatment with BRAF inhibitors. Combined dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, improved the response rate in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma versus dabrafenib monotherapy (67% vs.51%; p<0.002). However, median progression-free survival improved by only 2 weeks (9.3 months vs 8.8 months; HR = 0.75) compared with dabrafenib monotherapy (PMID: 23020132). Combination therapy is associated with less cutaneous toxicity than monotherapy, but systemic toxicity may be increased (PMID: 25287827, 25399551). Follow-up trials have demonstrated that all clinical measures inclusive of overall and median progression-free survival as well as objective response rates, median duration of response and number of patients with complete response favored patients treated with combination dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, compared to either dabrafenib or vemurafenib monotherapy, including patients who previously progressed on BRAF inhibitor monotherapy (PMID: 25287827, 25399551, 25265492). Additionally, patients with melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings have improved survival over patients given standard of care (PMID: 29361468, 28991513, 28891408). Promising clinical data has also suggested that addition of an immunotherapy agent to combination RAF and MEK inhibitor treatment may improve rate of overall response and duration of response in melanoma patients (PMID: 31171876, 31171879, 31171878).",

          "description": "Trametinib is an oral small molecule inhibitor of MEK1/2 that is FDA-approved alone or with dabrafenib for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma harboring a V600E or V600K BRAF mutation. In an open-label, randomized Phase III trial, patients with BRAF V600E/K-mutated unresectable, metastatic melanoma received oral trametinib (2 mg once daily) or an intravenous regimen of either dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2) or paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) every three weeks. Trametinib demonstrated improved progression-free survival (HR for disease progression or death = 0.45) and six-month overall survival (81% vs. 67%; death HR = 0.54; p=0.01) (PMID: 22663011). However, like other MEK inhibitors, the benefit of trametinib is limited by adverse reactions, most notably grade three or four rash and diarrhea (PMID: 22663011). Trametinib is not typically used as monotherapy for patients with BRAF V600K melanoma given its lower response rate compared to BRAF inhibitors and combined BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Patients previously treated with a RAF inhibitor appear to be less likely than untreated patients to respond to trametinib treatment (PMID: 22663011), and FDA guidelines state that trametinib as a monotherapy is not indicated for these patients. Dabrafenib and trametinib are FDA-approved as a combination therapy, which has superior clinical outcomes compared to dabrafenib or trametinib monotherapy (PMID: 25399551, 25265492). Additionally, patients with melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings had improved survival over patients given standard of care (PMID: 29361468).",

Specifically, median progression-free survival was 9.9 months in the combination arm versus 6.2 months in the control arm (HR = 0.51), with a complete response rate of 10% versus 4%, respectively, and interim nine-month overall survival of 81% versus 73%, respectively (PMID: 25265494). Follow-up analysis of the coBRIM trial showed two-year overall survival was 48.3% in the combination group versus 38.0% in the monotherapy group (PMID: 27480103), and five-year followup of the BRIM7 study showed a median overall survival of 31.8 months and a five-year survival rate of 39.2% (PMID: 31732523).",

FDA approval was based on the results of the Phase III COLUMBUS trial of combined encorafenib plus binimetinib versus single-agent vemurafenib in 577 patients with BRAF V600E- or V600K-mutant metastatic melanoma in which the median progression-free survival was 14.9 months (95% CI = 11.0-18.5) in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group versus 7.3 months (95% CI = 5.6-8.2) in the single agent vemurafenib group (HR= 0.54, 95% CI = 0.41-0.71; p<0·0001) (PMID: 29573941).

Vemurafenib has been shown to have nearly equivalent activity against melanomas with BRAF V600E and V600K mutations (PMID: 24508103). In a randomized Phase III trial comparing vemurafenib (960 mg orally twice daily) with dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2 i.v. every 3 weeks) for treatment-naive, metastatic, BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma, vemurafenib was associated with better overall survival (median survival 13.6 months vs. 9.7 months; hazard ratio 0.70, p=.0008) and longer median progression-free survival (6.9 months vs. 1.6 months) (PMID: 24508103). Final overall survival data from the BRIM-3 study showed that the survival advantage of vemurafenib over dacarbazine persisted through the 4-year landmark, with survival rates for vemurafenib and dacarbazine at the 4-year landmark being 17.0% and 15.6%, respectively (PMID: 28961848). However, a trial evaluating clinical outcomes in patients with melanoma treated with either combination therapy of dabrafenib and trametinib compared to those treated with vemurafenib monotherapy demonstrated improved survival outcomes in the combination-therapy group compared to the vemurafenib group (PMID: 25399551).",
