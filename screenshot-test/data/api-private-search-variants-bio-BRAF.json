Biochemically, it has been demonstrated that the BRAF S467L mutant signals as a dimer with CRAF, is RAS-dependent in its activation of the MAPK pathway, and, in tumors, would typically co-occur with another driver mechanism that amplifies RAS signaling (PMID: 28783719). Therefore, class III BRAF mutants like the BRAF S467L variant would be generally expected to co-occur with activating RAS mutations or NF1 inactivation in melanomas, whereas in non-small cell lung or colorectal cancers, this mutation will most likely be associated with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) hyperactivation at the protein level (PMID: 28783719).",

Substitutions at position V600 of BRAF, including the common BRAF V600E mutation, are known to be activating and oncogenic (PMID: 12068308, 16273091, 15035987). Expression of this mutation in 293T cells demonstrated that this mutation is activating as measured by increased downstream ERK activation and increased transcription of downstream MAPK pathway transcriptional targets (e.g. ELK) compared to wildtype BRAF (PMID: 20735442). A patient with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the BRAF V600G mutation had stable disease in response to treatment with vemutafenib, while a patient with sarcoma and a patient with esophagogastric cancer both harboring the BRAF V600G mutation had progressive disease in response to vemurafenib (PMID: 26287849).",

        "mutationEffectDescription": "The class I (PMID: 28783719) activating exon 15 BRAF V600K missense mutation is located in the kinase domain of the BRAF protein. BRAF V600 alterations (predominantly V600E) are recurrent in lung (PMID: 25079552, 23833300) and thyroid (PMID: 25417114) cancers, among others. In metastatic melanoma, frequency of V600K mutation is second only to V600E, the most common BRAF alteration (PMID: 26091043). Analysis of clinicopathologic features and outcome in patients with metastatic melanoma harboring activating BRAF mutations revealed that, compared to V600E, V600K mutation was significantly associated with male sex, older age (median age, head/neck primary tumor location, shorter interval to stage IV disease, and shorter overall survival from the time of diagnosis of stage IV disease (PMID: 23922205, 22535154). Comprehensive biological characterization of BRAF V600K mutation (PMID: 15035987, 26343582) has demonstrated that this mutation activates the downstream MAPK pathway independently of RAS (PMID: 19251651, 26343582), renders BRAF constitutively activated in monomeric form (PMID: 20179705) and retains sensitivity to RAF monomer inhibitors such as vemurafenib (PMID: 26343582, 28783719, 20179705). Preliminary studies suggest that BRAF V600K mutant tumors may not respond to combined BRAF and MEK inhibition as well as BRAF V600E tumors due to a decreased reliance on the MAPK pathway, though further studies are needed to validate this finding (PMID: 30630828).",

Substitutions at the D594 position in the BRAF protein kinase has been reported in melanoma, lung and colorectal cancers (PMID: 28481359). Biological characterization of the BRAF D594H mutation has demonstrated that it is RAS dependent in its activation of the MAPK pathway, signals as a dimer with CRAF, and typically co-occurs with another driver mechanism that amplifies RAS signaling (PMID: 28783719). While this mutation is sensitive to MEK inhibition by targeted inhibitors such as trametinib, it is insensitive to RAF monomer inhibitors such as vemurafenib. Thus, when BRAF D594H is observed in melanoma, it typically co-occurs with an activating RAS mutation or NF1 inactivation, whereas when observed in non-small cell lung or colorectal cancers, it is associated with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) hyperactivation at the protein level (PMID: 28783719).",

Biological characterization of the BRAF N581S mutation has demonstrated that it is RAS dependent in its activation of the MAPK pathway, signals as a dimer with CRAF, and typically co-occurs with another driver mechanism that amplifies RAS signaling (PMID: 15035987, 28783719). Thus, in melanoma, the N581S variant, similar to other class III BRAF mutants, would be expected to co-occur with activating RAS mutation or NF1 inactivation, whereas in non-small cell lung or colorectal cancers, this mutation would most likely be associated with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) hyperactivation at the protein level (PMID: 28783719). While this mutation is sensitive to MEK inhibition by targeted inhibitors such as trametinib, it is insensitive to RAF monomer inhibitors such as vemurafenib.",

This mutation has been recurrently found in melanoma, lung and colorectal cancers (PMID: 20141835, 28481359). Biological characterization of the BRAF D594A mutation has demonstrated that it is RAS dependent in its activation of the MAPK pathway, signals as a dimer with CRAF, and typically co-occurs with another driver mechanism that amplifies RAS signaling (PMID: 20141835, 28783719). Thus, when BRAF D594A is observed in melanoma, it typically co-occurs with an activating RAS mutation or NF1 inactivation, whereas when observed in non-small cell lung or colorectal cancers, it is associated with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) hyperactivation at the protein level (PMID: 28783719, 20141835).

This mutation has been reported in melanomas, lung and colorectal cancers, and in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (PMID: 28481359, 15046639, 27790118, 24446311).

Thus, when BRAF G466E is observed in melanoma, it typically co-occurs with an activating RAS mutation or NF1 inactivation, whereas when observed in non-small cell lung or colorectal cancers, it is associated with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) hyperactivation at the protein level (PMID: 28783719).

This fusion contains the BRAF kinase domain, but excludes the BRAF CR1 domain responsible for RAS binding and auto-inhibition (PMID: 18974108, 24345920). This fusion has been found in pilocytic astrocytoma (PMID: 18974108, 24345920). Expression of this fusion in NIH-3T3 cells demonstrated that it is activating as measured by constitutive kinase activity and increased anchorage independent growth in soft agar compared to wildtype BRAF (PMID: 18974108). KIAA1549-BRAF fusion protein functions as a dimer and is therefore not sensitive to RAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib in vitro (PMID: 23533272). Preclinical evidence suggests that these oncoproteins may be targeted by second-generation RAF inhibitors, which are reported to inhibit RAF dimers rather than induce their transactivation of RAF (as is the case with older inhibitors such as vemurafenib) (PMID: 23533272). In vitro studies have suggested that pediatric astrocytoma cell lines harboring the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion are resistant to treatment with first generation RAF inhibitors (PMID: 23533272, 26072686). In a Phase II clinical trial of selumetinib in 25 patients with WHO grade I pilocytic astrocytoma harboring either the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion or the BRAF V600E mutation, nine patients (36% [95% CI:18-57%]) had a sustained partial response (PMID: 31151904).",

This mutation has been reported in melanomas, lung and colorectal cancers, and in cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (PMID: 28481359, 15046639, 26498038, 16439621, 22649091). Biological characterization of the BRAF G466V mutation has demonstrated that it is RAS dependent in its activation of the MAPK pathway, signals as a dimer with CRAF, and typically co-occurs with another driver mechanism that amplifies RAS signaling (PMID: 15035987, 26498038, 22649091, 16364920, 24202393, 28783719). Thus, when BRAF G466V is observed in melanoma, it typically co-occurs with an activating RAS mutation or NF1 inactivation, whereas when observed in non-small cell lung or colorectal cancers, it is associated with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) hyperactivation at the protein level (PMID: 28783719). While this mutation is sensitive to MEK inhibition by targeted inhibitors such as trametinib, it is insensitive to RAF monomer inhibitors such as vemurafenib.",

A clinicopathologic study of a cohort of 1119 Australian patients with known BRAF mutant status positive melanomas demonstrated that, at 3.4% of patients, BRAF L597 mutations are some of the most commonly occurring BRAF non-V600E mutations.

This mutation has been found in non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma (PMID: 22798288, 23833300, 26498038, 28783719) (Abstract: Noeparast et al. Abstract# 11091, ASCO 2015. http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/33/15_suppl/11091). Biological characterization of the BRAF D594N mutation has demonstrated that it is RAS dependent in its activation of the MAPK pathway, signals as a dimer with CRAF, and typically co-occurs with another driver mechanism that amplifies RAS signaling (PMID: 28783719, 26498038). Thus, when BRAF D594N is observed in melanoma, it typically co-occurs with an activating RAS mutation or NF1 inactivation, whereas when observed in non-small cell lung or colorectal cancers, it is associated with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) hyperactivation at the protein level (PMID: 28783719). While this mutation is sensitive to MEK inhibition by targeted inhibitors such as trametinib, it is insensitive to RAF monomer inhibitors such as vemurafenib (PMID: 28783719).",

A clinicopathologic study of a cohort of 1119 Australian patients with known BRAF mutant status positive melanomas demonstrated that at 3.4% of patients, BRAF L597 mutations are some of the most commonly occurring BRAF non-V600E mutations.

This mutation encodes a truncated, 16 kDa BRAF protein that has the V600E mutation but lacks the RAS binding domain and constitutively dimerizes (PMID: 22113612). This mutation has been found in melanoma (PMID: 22113612). In concordance with its ability to constitutively dimerize, in vitro studies of this mutation suggest that it is resistant to vemurafenib, as measured by persistent MAPK pathway signaling and cell proliferation upon drug treatment (PMID: 22113612). In one study, six out of nineteen patients with melanomas that were resistant to vemurafenib harbored the p61BRAF(V600E) mutation (PMID: 22113612). In a second study, BRAF splice variants were found in several patient-derived xenografts that were generated from patients who progressed on BRAF inhibitors (PMID: 27320919).",
