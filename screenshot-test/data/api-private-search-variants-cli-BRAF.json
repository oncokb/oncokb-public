In a phase I clinical trial for patients with refractory or relapsed solid tumors with or without BRAF mutation, there were two (28%) partial responses of seven evaluable BRAF-mutant patients treated with PLX8394 and cobicistat, a CYP3A4 inhibitor (Abstract: Janku et al. Abstract# B176, AACR-NCI-EORTC 2017. http://mct.aacrjournals.org/content/17/1_Supplement/B176). Both responses were in patients with BRAF V600 mutations. Preclinical studies show that PLX8394 specifically inhibits BRAF-containing dimers and inhibits proliferation and pathway activation in BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer cell lines (PMID: 26466569, 28659148, 30559419, 28783719).",

FDA approval of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib was based on results from an open-label Phase III study of combination therapy versus dabrafenib monotherapy in 247 patients with metastatic melanoma who were naive to treatment with BRAF inhibitors. Combined dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, improved the response rate in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma versus dabrafenib monotherapy (67% vs.51%; p<0.002). However, median progression-free survival improved by only 2 weeks (9.3 months vs 8.8 months; HR = 0.75) compared with dabrafenib monotherapy (PMID: 23020132). Combination therapy is associated with less cutaneous toxicity than monotherapy, but systemic toxicity may be increased (PMID: 25287827, 25399551). Follow-up trials have demonstrated that all clinical measures inclusive of overall and median progression-free survival as well as objective response rates, median duration of response and number of patients with complete response favored patients treated with combination dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, compared to either dabrafenib or vemurafenib monotherapy, including patients who previously progressed on BRAF inhibitor monotherapy (PMID: 25287827, 25399551, 25265492). Additionally, patients with melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings have improved survival over patients given standard of care (PMID: 29361468, 28991513, 28891408). Promising clinical data has also suggested that addition of an immunotherapy agent to combination RAF and MEK inhibitor treatment may improve rate of overall response and duration of response in melanoma patients (PMID: 31171876, 31171879, 31171878).",

        "drugDescription": "Trametinib is an oral small molecule inhibitor of MEK1/2 that is FDA-approved alone or with dabrafenib for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma harboring a V600E or V600K BRAF mutation. In an open-label, randomized Phase III trial, patients with BRAF V600E/K-mutated unresectable, metastatic melanoma received oral trametinib (2 mg once daily) or an intravenous regimen of either dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2) or paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) every three weeks. Trametinib demonstrated improved progression-free survival (HR for disease progression or death = 0.45) and six-month overall survival (81% vs. 67%; death HR = 0.54; p=0.01) (PMID: 22663011). However, like other MEK inhibitors, the benefit of trametinib is limited by adverse reactions, most notably grade three or four rash and diarrhea (PMID: 22663011). Trametinib is not typically used as monotherapy for patients with BRAF V600K melanoma given its lower response rate compared to BRAF inhibitors and combined BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Patients previously treated with a RAF inhibitor appear to be less likely than untreated patients to respond to trametinib treatment (PMID: 22663011), and FDA guidelines state that trametinib as a monotherapy is not indicated for these patients. Dabrafenib and trametinib are FDA-approved as a combination therapy, which has superior clinical outcomes compared to dabrafenib or trametinib monotherapy (PMID: 25399551, 25265492). Additionally, patients with melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings had improved survival over patients given standard of care (PMID: 29361468).",

FDA approval of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib was based on results from an open-label Phase III study of combination therapy versus dabrafenib monotherapy in 247 patients with metastatic melanoma who were naive to treatment with BRAF inhibitors. Combined dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, improved the response rate in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma versus dabrafenib monotherapy (67% vs.51%; p<0.002). However, median progression-free survival improved by only two weeks (9.3 months vs 8.8 months; HR = 0.75) compared with dabrafenib monotherapy (PMID: 23020132). Combination therapy is associated with less cutaneous toxicity than monotherapy, but systemic toxicity may be increased (PMID: 25287827, 25399551). Follow-up trials have demonstrated that all clinical measures inclusive of overall and median progression-free survival as well as objective response rates, median duration of response and number of patients with complete response favored patients treated with combination dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, compared to either dabrafenib or vemurafenib monotherapy, including patients who previously progressed on BRAF inhibitor monotherapy (PMID: 25287827, 25399551, 25265492). Additionally, patients with melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings have improved survival over patients given standard of care (PMID: 29361468, 28991513, 28891408). Promising clinical data has also suggested that addition of an immunotherapy agent to combination RAF and MEK inhibitor treatment may improve rate of overall response and duration of response in melanoma patients (PMID: 31171876, 31171879, 31171878).",

FDA approval of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib was based on results from an open-label Phase III study of combination therapy versus dabrafenib monotherapy in 247 patients with metastatic melanoma who were naive to treatment with BRAF inhibitors. Combined dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, improved the response rate in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma versus dabrafenib monotherapy (67% vs.51%; p<0.002). However, median progression-free survival improved by only 2 weeks (9.3 months vs 8.8 months; HR = 0.75) compared with dabrafenib monotherapy (PMID: 23020132). Combination therapy is associated with less cutaneous toxicity than monotherapy, but systemic toxicity may be increased (PMID: 25287827, 25399551). Follow-up trials have demonstrated that all clinical measures inclusive of overall and median progression-free survival as well as objective response rates, median duration of response and number of patients with complete response favored patients treated with combination dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, compared to either dabrafenib or vemurafenib monotherapy, including patients who previously progressed on BRAF inhibitor monotherapy (PMID: 25287827, 25399551, 25265492). Additionally, patients with melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings have improved survival over patients given standard of care (PMID: 29361468, 28991513, 28891408). Promising clinical data has also suggested that addition of an immunotherapy agent to combination RAF and MEK inhibitor treatment may improve rate of overall response and duration of response in melanoma patients (PMID: 31171876, 31171879, 31171878).",

In a phase I clinical trial for patients with refractory or relapsed solid tumors with or without BRAF mutation, there were two (28%) partial responses of seven evaluable BRAF-mutant patients treated with PLX8394 and cobicistat, a CYP3A4 inhibitor (Abstract: Janku et al. Abstract# B176, AACR-NCI-EORTC 2017. http://mct.aacrjournals.org/content/17/1_Supplement/B176). Both responses were in patients with BRAF V600 mutations. Preclinical studies show that PLX8394 specifically inhibits BRAF-containing dimers and inhibits proliferation and pathway activation in BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer cell lines (PMID: 26466569, 28659148, 30559419, 28783719).",

In an open-label, randomized Phase III trial, patients with BRAF V600E/K-mutated unresectable, metastatic melanoma received oral trametinib (2 mg once daily) or an intravenous regimen of either dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2) or paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) every three weeks. Trametinib demonstrated improved progression-free survival (HR for disease progression or death = 0.45) and six-month overall survival (81% vs. 67%; death HR = 0.54; p=0.01) (PMID: 22663011). However, like other MEK inhibitors, the benefit of trametinib is limited by adverse reactions, most notably grade three or four rash and diarrhea (PMID: 22663011). Trametinib is not typically used as monotherapy for patients with BRAF V600K melanoma given its lower response rate compared to BRAF inhibitors and combined BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Patients previously treated with a RAF inhibitor appear to be less likely than untreated patients to respond to trametinib treatment (PMID: 22663011), and FDA guidelines state that trametinib as a monotherapy is not indicated for these patients. Dabrafenib and trametinib are FDA-approved as a combination therapy, which has superior clinical outcomes compared to dabrafenib or trametinib monotherapy (PMID: 25399551, 25265492). Additionally, patients with melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings had improved survival over patients given standard of care (PMID: 29361468).",

In a randomized Phase III trial comparing vemurafenib (960 mg orally twice daily) with dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2 i.v. every 3 weeks) for treatment-naive, metastatic, BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma, vemurafenib was associated with better overall survival (median survival 13.6 months vs. 9.7 months; hazard ratio 0.70, p=.0008) and longer median progression-free survival (6.9 months vs. 1.6 months) (PMID: 24508103). Final overall survival data from the BRIM-3 study showed that the survival advantage of vemurafenib over dacarbazine persisted through the 4-year landmark, with survival rates for vemurafenib and dacarbazine at the 4-year landmark being 17.0% and 15.6%, respectively (PMID: 28961848). However, a trial evaluating clinical outcomes in patients with melanoma treated with either combination therapy of dabrafenib and trametinib compared to those treated with vemurafenib monotherapy demonstrated improved survival outcomes in the combination-therapy group compared to the vemurafenib group (PMID: 25399551).",
