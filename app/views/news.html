        <p>
            We are happy to announce the <b>first release of OncoKB</b>, a knowledge base for precision medicine. Our
            goal is
            to comprehensively annotate the oncogenic effect of mutations observed in cancer, as well as their
            therapeutic
            implications.
            This release contains information about almost 3,000 variants in 418 cancer genes. For each variant, we
            categorize the biological and clinical effect, along with citations of the source of the information, and,
            when
            available, the therapeutic implications of a variant. We have focussed on FDA-approved (Level 1) or
            guideline-listed (Level 2) biomarkers, as well as biomarkers that with clinical evidence for sensitivity and
            for
            which therapies are currently explored in clinical trials (Level 3). See the Levels of Evidence and
            Actionable
            Genes pages for more information.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have also <b>integrated information from OncoKB into the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics</b>. When
            exploring
            variants in <a href="http://www.cbioportal.org/" target="_blank">cbioportal.org</a>, you will see
            annotations from
            OncoKB when available.
